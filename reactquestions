# Here are 30 key React.js interview questions to help you prepare:

1. **What is React and what are its benefits?**[4]
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage application state. Key benefits include a virtual DOM for fast updates, one-way data binding for better performance, and a component-based architecture for modularity.[4]

2. **What is the virtual DOM and how does it work?**[4]
The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When state changes, React creates a new virtual DOM tree, compares it to the previous version, and applies the minimal required updates to the real DOM. This diffing process makes updates efficient compared to directly manipulating the DOM.[4]

3. **What are the different lifecycle methods in React?**[5]
The main lifecycle methods are:
- Mounting: constructor(), static getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), componentDidMount()
- Updating: static getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(), componentDidUpdate() 
- Unmounting: componentWillUnmount()
- Error Handling: static getDerivedStateFromError(), componentDidCatch()

4. **What are the differences between functional and class components?**[5]
Functional components are simpler, use hooks for state and lifecycle, and are more performant. Class components require extending React.Component, use this.state for state, and have access to lifecycle methods. Functional components are now the recommended approach for most use cases.

5. **What are props in React and how are they used?**[5]
Props (properties) are used to pass data from parent to child components. They are read-only and should not be modified by the child component. Props can be accessed via this.props in class components and directly in functional components.

6. **What is state in React and how is it used?**[5]
State represents the internal data of a component that determines its behavior and rendering. State is managed within the component and can be updated using setState() in class components or the useState hook in functional components. State should be kept as simple and minimal as possible.

7. **How do you handle events in React?**[4]
Event handlers are passed as props to components. They are named using camelCase and passed a synthetic event object. The event handlers are defined within the component class or as functions. Calling preventDefault() is necessary to avoid the default browser behavior.

8. **What are keys in React and why are they important?**[5]
Keys are unique identifiers assigned to elements inside an array. They help React keep track of which items have changed, been added, or been removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings.

9. **What are forms in React and how are they handled?**[5]
Forms in React work similarly to regular HTML forms, but with some differences. Form elements like input, textarea, and select maintain their own state and update it based on user input. To control the values of these elements, we use controlled components where React state becomes the single source of truth.

10. **What is JSX in React?**[4]
JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax used by React. It allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. JSX code gets transformed to regular JavaScript function calls and object instantiations using a tool like Babel. JSX is not a requirement for using React, but it makes code more readable and writing components easier.

11. **What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React?**[5]
Higher-order components are advanced techniques for reusing component logic. A higher-order component is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with additional functionality. HOCs are a powerful way to enhance the functionality of existing components without modifying their implementation.

12. **What is the Context API in React?**[5]
The Context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It provides a way to share values between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. This is useful for themes, user language, authentication status, etc.

13. **What are hooks in React?**[5]
Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React features like state and lifecycle methods from function components. They allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. Some of the most commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, and useCallback.

14. **What is the purpose of useEffect hook?**[5]
The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in class components. It is used for fetching data, manually changing the DOM, setting up subscriptions, timers, and more. The effect can optionally return a cleanup function.

15. **What is the difference between useState and useReducer hooks?**[5]
useState is a basic hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns the current state and a function to update it. useReducer is an alternative to useState when you have complex state logic. It uses a reducer function to manage state transitions. useReducer is useful when you have multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous state.

16. **What is the purpose of useCallback hook?**[5]
The useCallback hook is used to optimize performance by memoizing callback functions. It returns a memoized version of the callback function that only changes if the dependencies change. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

17. **What is the purpose of useMemo hook?**[5]
The useMemo hook is used to memoize expensive functions so that they are not called on every render. It returns a memoized value. It is useful for optimizing performance by avoiding expensive calculations on every render. However, it should not be used as a premature optimization.

18. **What is the purpose of useRef hook?**[5]
The useRef hook is used to create a mutable reference to a DOM element or a value that persists across renders. It returns a ref object with a current property that can be used to store any value. Refs are commonly used to access DOM nodes, store previous values, and hold mutable state.

19. **How do you handle asynchronous data loading in React?**[4]
Asynchronous data loading can be handled using hooks like useState and useEffect. The useEffect hook is used to trigger the API call when the component mounts. The useState hook is used to store the loading state and the fetched data. Error handling can be done by adding a try-catch block inside the useEffect hook.

20. **What is code splitting in React and why is it important?**[5]
Code splitting is a technique that allows you to split your application code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This helps improve the initial load time of your application by only loading the code required to render the initial view. React supports code splitting out of the box using dynamic imports. This is important for performance optimization and reducing the initial bundle size.

21. **What is the purpose of React.memo higher-order component?**[5]
React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes a functional component. It is similar to shouldComponentUpdate in class components. It is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the component by comparing the previous and current props. If the props are the same, it will skip rendering the component and reuse the previous result.

22. **What is the purpose of React.lazy and Suspense?**[5]
React.lazy allows you to dynamically import components when they are rendered. It enables code splitting by splitting the application code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. Suspense is used to handle the loading state while the lazy component is being fetched. It allows you to display a fallback UI until the lazy component is loaded.

23. **What is the purpose of the key prop in React?**[5]
The key prop is a special string attribute that helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside an array to give the elements a stable identity. The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings.

24. **What is the purpose of the ref prop in React?**[5]
The ref prop is used to create a reference to a DOM element or a class instance. It allows you to access the underlying DOM element or the instance of a component directly. Refs are commonly used to access DOM nodes, store previous values, and hold mutable state.

25. **What is the purpose of the children prop in React?**[5]
The children prop is used to pass content between opening and closing tags of a component. It allows you to pass arbitrary data to a component as its children. Children can be a string, a number, a boolean, null, undefined, or even React elements.

26. **What is the purpose of the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop in React?**[5]
The dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop is used to set HTML content directly from React. It is the React equivalent of setting innerHTML in the browser DOM. It is called dangerously because it can easily lead to XSS vulnerabilities if you render user-generated content. It should be used with caution and only when you are sure the content is safe.

27. **What is the purpose of the propTypes library in React?**[5]
The propTypes library is used to validate the props passed to a component. It allows you to define the type of each prop and whether it is required or not. This helps catch bugs early and improves the overall quality of your code. It also serves as documentation for the component's API.

28. **What is the purpose of the defaultProps property in React?**[5]
The defaultProps property is used to set default values for props in a component. It allows you to specify default values for props that are not provided by the parent component. This is useful for making components more reusable and reducing the need for conditional checks.

29. **What is the purpose of the React.StrictMode component?**[5]
The React.StrictMode component is used to enable additional checks and warnings for its descendants. It helps identify potential issues in an application. When strict mode is enabled, React will run additional checks and warnings for the components inside it. This is useful for identifying unsafe lifecycles, unexpected side effects, and unexpected mutations.

30. **What is the purpose of the React.Fragment component?**[5]
The React.Fragment component is used to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. It allows you to return multiple elements from a component without wrapping them in an extra div or other container element. This is useful for avoiding unnecessary DOM elements and improving performance.
